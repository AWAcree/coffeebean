Hello there! 


Welcome to my project for Code Louisville. 

This is a simple, brochure style site emulating what you might normally see for a coffee shop business. 

It features a contact form, which utilizes javascript to enter and validate data for marketing communication. 

The mobile version will feature a menu button which utilizes css & javascript to display a hamburger menu, allowing for a sleeker design of the page. 

The project also uses flexbox to organize content based on whether the site is opened on mobile or desktop. 

Finally The site will incorporate the google map api to show the location of the Coffee Shop. 


Thank you for visiting and please enjoy your stay!!!
