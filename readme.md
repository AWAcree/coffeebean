Hello there! 


Welcome to my project for Code Louisville. 

This is a simple, brochure style site emulating what you might normally see for a coffee shop. 

It features a contact form, which utilizes javascript to enter and store data for marketing communication. 

The mobile version will feature a menu button which utilizes css & javascript to display a slideover menu, allowing for a sleeker design of the page. 

The project also uses flexbox to organize content based on whether the site is opened on mobile or desktop. 

Finally The logo in the center will feature an animation when hovered over. 


Thank you for visiting and please enjoy your stay!!!
